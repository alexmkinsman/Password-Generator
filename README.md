# Password-Generator

This password generator used tools learned in the second module and I had to use lots of different resources while making it. My instructor was very helpful in answering questions and giving additional resources. The use of conditionals and variables really pushed me to think like a programmer. Eventually, I came up with a working site. I had the files in folders originally, but the index file could not find the js or css files, so I put them all on the same page in hopes they'd connect. While this is not best practice, it was the only way I could get them to connect. The pages worked together in my live browser, but when published, are faulty. I am not sure what is going wrong and will ask my instructor tomorrow.
